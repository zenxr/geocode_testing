# geocode-api

Testing Google Geocode API. This application was built with cookiecutter in order to rapidly stand it up with sane defaults. For example, inclusion of a (mostly) autogenerated documentation service, debugging tools, middleware, etc.

# Notes

## Running the App

I ran the application exclusively via Docker, but Documentation for running locally is available in Django-Cookiecutter documentation.

- Set an environment variable `GEOCODING_API_KEY` with your Geocode API key.
- `.envs` directory is not included in source control for obvious reasons. `.envs` could be included if the version control system was only accessible internally and requires authorization. Otherwise, these directories would have to be copied to the server running the application. Docker and Django *should* have sane generated defaults outside of setting the Geocode API Key. **I can include the `.envs` directory on request, but will not provide a Google GeoCode API Key**.
- Provided you have docker set up, `docker-compose -f local.yml up` (development) or `docker-compose -f production.yml up` to run in production mode.

## Design Considerations

- Google Geocode API explicitly states no caching is allowed of the data from their services, so interaction with the API strictly occurs through an API Wrapper.
    - Performance could've been increased by caching previously received responses, but this doesn't seem to be allowed.
    - PlaceID is allowed to be stored, but no performance gains from storing just this
- Bulk of the 'work' was done in `geocode-api/geocode`
    - The geocode 'service' is a module that contained no real state, so no class encapsulating it
    - `apis.py` defines the endpoints, and outside of parameter validation passes work off to `service.py`
    - `geocode_classes.py` contains the Geocode API Wrapper among a few other things

## Improvements

- Could add support for API Keys rather than requiring authentication
- Introduce better use of logging module
- More robust linking between endpoints to fully meet REST backlink standards, which is often ignored.

# Application Information

## Settings

Moved to [settings](http://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/settings.html).

## Basic Commands

### Setting Up Your Users

-   To create a **normal user account**, just go to Sign Up and fill out the form. Once you submit it, you'll see a "Verify Your E-mail Address" page. Go to your console to see a simulated email verification message. Copy the link into your browser. Now the user's email should be verified and ready to go.

-   To create a **superuser account**, use this command:

        $ python manage.py createsuperuser

For convenience, you can keep your normal user logged in on Chrome and your superuser logged in on Firefox (or similar), so that you can see how the site behaves for both kinds of users.

## Deployment
